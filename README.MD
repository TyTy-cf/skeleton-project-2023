To use the script and have it working :

- In the "CollectionType" field in FormType, you need to add this

```php
'attr' => [
    'data-list-selector' => 'YOUR_KEY_NAME'
],
```

- Add a "ButtonType" right after, like this :

```php
->add('buttonAddENTITY_NAME', ButtonType::class, [
    'label' => 'YOUR LABEL',
    'attr' => [
        'class' => 'btn btn-primary',
        'data-btn-selector' => 'YOUR_KEY_NAME',
    ]
])
```

The _'data-list-selector'_ and the _'data-btn-selector'_ has to match their values to make the script working.
